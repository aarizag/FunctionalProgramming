Is that true for all functions? For example, if you define a .__abc__ method does that create an abc function?
    No, the len() function is defined, more or less, as
    def len(obj):
        return obj.__len__()
    so one would need to define a seperate abc() function that does the same thing



What does PEP stand for?
    Python Enhancement Proposal. Basically the source for suggesting major changes and improvements for python


When do you recommend using type comments and when type hints?
    Type comments should be used in code written in python 3.5 and prior. Else, hints are better.


How do you write card suits: "♠ ♡ ♢ ♣"?
    by copy pasting it in from the internet
    More likely by using the alt codes for html.



What is random.shuffle?
    A function in the python module 'random' that randomly shuffles the items in a sequence.



Do you understand how deal_hands() works?
    the deck is divided into 4 sequences using the syntax
    seq[start:end:step]
    so, 'deck[0::4]' starts at the 0th position and grabs every fourth card until the end of the deck.
    All 'hands' start at +1 index to ensure no players have an identical card


What does names = "P1 P2 P3 P4".split() do?
    returns the list ["P1", "P2", "P3", "P4"] which is the original string split at the spaces.



What does <for name, cards in hands.items()> do?
    "For every name-cards combination in the dictionary 'hands', do..."



What does <card_str = " ".join(f"{s}{r}" for (s, r) in cards)> do?
    Creates a string by making a smaller string of the suit and rank of every card
    Then joining them all together with spaces in between



In the line <version: Tuple[int, int, int] = (3, 7, 1)> the type of version is Tuple[int, int, int].
Does that mean that the type of version is a list of three ints?
    No, it means it is always a Tuple with 3 int elements.




In
from typing import List, Tuple
Card = Tuple[str, str]
Card is a type alias. Is it also an object the program can manipulate?
For example, can you write and execute: print(Card)?
    Executing 'print(Card)', you get 'typing.Tuple[int,int,int]'
    Aliases from typing are indeed objects that can be manipulated, but I do not believe that is good practice.



In the method player_order, what does the return line return?
    It returns all the names of the players after the index given, followed by all the names of the players prior




What does it mean to say that "int is a subtype of float but not a subclass of float."?
    Every int can be considered a float, but not every float can be considered an int.
    This means that int does not retain all the functions or qualities of a float




When I ran

reveal_type(choose(["Guido", "Jukka", "Ivan"]))
reveal_type(choose([1, 2, 3]))
reveal_type(choose([True, 42, 3.14]))
reveal_type(choose(["Python", 3, 7]))

I got Choosable? as the revealed type in all cases, which is not what Hjelle got. What did you get?
    TODO:: RUN CODE ONCE MYPY and CONFIGURATION ARE ADDED




Which parts of this tutorial should you expect to understand, to remember?
What should you do about the other parts? How do you deal with situations in which there is
more information than you can handle?
