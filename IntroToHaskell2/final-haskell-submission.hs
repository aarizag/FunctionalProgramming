Question: Such a situation would produce an infinite loop in Java. Why doesnâ€™t this lead
to an infinite loop in Haskell? Does it lead to an infinite loop in Python?

    It still produces an infinite list in Haskell, but since Haskell is lazy,
    it only evaluates as far as it needs to. Thus, while the list is infinite,
    Haskell will only look as far as it needs to to find the values it needs.
    Python is not lazy witb recursive evaluation, so a list function would need
    to terminate before the rest of the program to continue.


Question: What happens with the following? Explain why.
> cyc12 = myCycle [1,2]
-- Is this an infinite loop? What about Python? Why or why not?

    This is an infinite loop in Haskell but the implementation would need
    to be different in Python to allow the rest of the program to execute
    but retain the intended cycle.

> take 5 cyc12
-- Does this result in an infinite loop? What about Python? Why or why not?

    This does not result in an infinite loop in Haskell since the language
    is lazy. It only evaluates what it needs to.


Question: Walk through the step-by-step evaluation of
> take 5 cyc12

You may assume that take is implemented as follows
    take 0 _ = []
    take _ [] = []
    take n (x:xs) = x : take (n-1) xs

and that (++) is implemented as follows.
    [] ++ ys = ys
    (x:xs) ++ ys = x:(xs ++ ys)

For my purposes, I am defining myCycle as:
    myCycle :: [a] -> [a]
    myCycle x = x ++ myCycle x

>> cyc12 = myCycle [1,2]
>> take 5 cyc12
-> take 5 (cyc12 ++ myCycle cyc12)
-> take 5 ([1,2] ++ myCycle [1,2])
-> take 5 (1 : ([2] ++ myCycle [1,2]))
-> 1 : take 4 ([2] ++ myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : take 4 (2 : ([] ++ myCycle [1,2]))
-> 1 : 2 : take 3 ([] ++ myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : 2 : take 3 (myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : 2 : take 3 ([1,2] ++ myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : 2 : take 3 (1 : ([2] ++ myCycle [1,2]))
-> 1 : 2 : 1 : take 2 ([2] ++ myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : 2 : 1 : take 2 (2 : ([] ++ myCycle [1,2]))
-> 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 : take 1 ([] ++ myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 : take 1 (myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 : take 1 ([1,2] ++ myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 : take 1 (1 : ([2] ++ myCycle [1,2]))
-> 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 : 1 : take 0 ([2] ++ myCycle [1,2])
-> 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 : 1 : []


** For a python equivalent of this operation, one would need to define a circular linked list for
** the operation to not end in an infinite loop


Question: Is there a Python equivalent [to using insertion sort to find the smallest element]?
If so, does it have the same time complexity?

    There is an equivalent in python, but the complexity would O(n^2) since python would not evaluate it lazily. The
    entire list would be sorted before pulling the first element.

   Question 6 - Function Pairs 
-}

{-
  For these functions, you can use either integers or floats

  All of these functions, when given a function, return a function which applies the given function
  on a list of elements, and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple follows the pattern where the first
  element is the element used to calculate the resultant when applied the given function, and the
  second element is that resultant.
  For example, if we assume that the function f() was given, then the tuple is as such: ( x , f(x) ),
  where x is an element from the given list. The resulting list, is a list of these structured tuples.

Question: Is your while function tail recursive. Why or why not?

It is tail recursive, as the accumulator keeps updating at each recursive call of 
while and it does not have to wait till the last while call to evaluate the result.
At the final call, the final result is calculated by the result extractor and 
returned to the parent calls.

Question: Explain how nSquares works. What is the state? What do its components represent?

state is the accumulator on which the bodyFn performs the operation and returns the new
state. (index, list) is the form of state in this example. index keeps track of the iteration
count and list accumulates the results at each bodyFn operation.

For clarity, I will use following notations:
eval = (\(index, _) -> index <= n)
bodyFn = (\(index, list) -> (index + 1, index^2 : list))
extractRes = (reverse . snd)
